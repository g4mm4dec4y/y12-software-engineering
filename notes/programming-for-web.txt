S.E. Procedure/Module

Tags, attributes > selectors/classes, attributes > functionality

Site controlled through the Document Object Model (Object Oriented)
Class is common in JS and CSS
Selector: properties; attributes and methods

Procedures are part of procedural/imperative/module paradigm
One returns, one makes something happen: functions and subroutines
Function always returns

<input type=“hidden” id=“clicked” value=“no”>
above: stores a value

.innerHTML accesses space within the tags to modify or set.

Dot notation = object.property
attribute vs methods - in js method always has brackets in it
e.g. document.method().attribute 

Line PWA and site is blurry. PWA vs site diff -> functionality.
Uses resources of browser
